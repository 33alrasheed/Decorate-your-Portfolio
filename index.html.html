	<!-- 
	  Directions:
		1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content.
		2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text.
		3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text, "Software Developer."
		4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag, which will make a horizontal line.
		5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______.")

		6. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects."
		7. Create a paragraph tag that says "Coming Soon."
		8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me."
		9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. HINT: You will need to do a search for this text...it is long! Alternatively, grab a sample from this site: https://generator.lorem-ipsum.info/

		BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early.
		  - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/).
		  - Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me," a paragraph tag containing your email, and a paragraph tag containing your phone number (these can be fake!).

        <p> Famed theoretical physicist Richard Feynman once said to “study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.” Not until later in academic career did I truly learn to embrace his advice. Earlier in my career, I misunderstood the university educational system. I was always thinking about how to just survive the course and pass. In doing so, I realized that I was so worried about my GPA that I forgot to learn. However, all this changed during my junior year when I started reading more advanced topics and asking my fluid mechanics professor about nano and micro calculations and why they were so different from macro calculations. After seeing my interest, my professor invited me to join his research team as an observer, which proved to be my first experience with scientific research. This completely changed my attitude as I was fueled by the process of speculation, imagination, and calculation in order to observe a phenomenon. My educational goals shifted from obtaining superficial knowledge to a focus on understanding and application, which revolutionized my learning experience. My newfound enthusiasm eventually motivated me to petition the Senior Advisory Board to allow me to conduct original research for my senior design project.   </p>
